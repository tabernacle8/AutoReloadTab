# AutoReloadTab

It's a chrome extension that reloads the tab.... thats it. Now manifest V3 compliant (With some changes sigh).

Always open for pull requests, always open to feedback.
## WE'RE BRINGING THIS EXTENSION BACK | Current Version: 3.1.0

- Experimental (But way better) support for manifest V3
- Dual protocol support: The extension chooses wether to use chrome alarms or setTimeout depending on reload intervals
- Fixed a few visual bugs
